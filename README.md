Aim
===

The aim of launch.py is to create an arborescence and to launch a program in every final subdirectory in one shot. Every process will be executed on a different thread and you can specify the maximum thread that will run in the same time. The number of simultaneous threads should not exceed the number of logical core of the machine you use.


Utilisation
============

It works with a recent version of Python 2. This version of launch.py must be modified to fit your needs.


Licence
=======

The program comes with no warranty. It is intended for academic research, so you should verify it is correct for your use.
